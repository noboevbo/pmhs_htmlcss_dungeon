      <p>TheThe moment I fully grasped the danger of my situation in the opening few hours of Cyberpunk 2077, I had just opted to take a hit of a particularly dodgy illegal substance. The drug came from a junkie gangster with a spider-like face full of red cybernetic eyes. His name, he insisted, was Dum Dum. As a street kid, my chosen "life path" in the game, I recognized the name of the aerosolized adrenaline-booster and was able to chat cordially with our frightening host about it. Had I come from a corporate background or been a wandering nomad type passing through Night City, I might not have known.</p>

San Andreas is the biggest of the trio and arguably is the most beloved game in the GTA series. It introduced the world to the fictional version of California that would also be the setting for the best-selling Grand Theft Auto V. Midnight Club: Los Angeles, meanwhile, is a racer that came out in 2008, and at present, it’s the last title in the series to be released, while Table Tennis is a shockingly in-depth look at the sport from a developer best-known for violent action games.</p>
